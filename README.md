# MaptyApp
Created an application-based project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The project uses a Map API, namely, Leaflet to display location markers on a Map
The project is part of a course on Udemy offered by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This is the second project in which I used an API. The APIs used in this project are Leaflet, for the map rendering, and localStorage to store data entered in the brower.

Features to add in the future: 
1. A feature to delete an added marker.
2. A feature to delete all the markers.
3. Set z axis in such a way that all the markers are visible.
4. Add polygons.
